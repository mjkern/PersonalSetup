# Personal Setup
This repository is used for storing a bunch of things I find useful when seting up a new linux installation.

## Windows Subsystem for Linux
Once you have installed WSL, run the following:
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjkern/PersonalSetup/master/wslSetup.sh | sudo -E bash -
```

Then you should be all set.
